        Lima,Peru
    </h1>
    <p>
        I'm fascinated by Lima, which envelops you with its humid climate due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean. But
        the
        true magic of Lima lies in its people. They are incredibly homey, making you feel welcome. They are also
        incredibly
        resilient, never giving up and always finding a way forward, with admirable creativity in every corner, from
        their
        vibrant street art to their innovative offerings.

        What makes Lima special is that we find two temples: the Temple of the Olives and the Temple of Lima-La Molina.
        I love
        those temples.
