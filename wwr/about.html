            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Our journey began years ago with a simple passion for the river. What started as a small group of friends
                exploring local rapids has grown into a premier rafting outfitter. We believe in sharing the power and
                beauty of the river with others, and this belief has led us to a successful business. Our company has
                evolved from a family passion to a world-class whitewater experience, successfully guiding thousands of
                people down some of the most exciting rivers in the country, creating lasting memories and forging a
                community of fellow river enthusiasts. Our history is a testament to our dedication to the sport and the
                people who love it.</p>
